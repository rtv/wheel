# An experimental swarm robot controller for Stage


## Notes

Goal: 
* create entities that exist only in the dynamic behaviours of multiple robots
* the robots recharge themselves
* entities survive much longer than any robot charge cycle
* entities are autopoetic
 - they hunt for charged-up robots
